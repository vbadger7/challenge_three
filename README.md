This is a payroll form that asks for user input. Once all the employees have been submitted, it asks if you would like to add any more, giving the user an option to hit cancel. After the user hits cancel, the website displays all the input that was typed in to include the name last name and salary of the employee.

After that function has been successfully met, in the console log the page then takes all the salaries for the employees entered and returns an average.

After that function has been successfully met, the page then selects a random employee as the winner for the drawing. This can also be seen in the console log.
